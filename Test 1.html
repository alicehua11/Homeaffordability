Hello, this map is a look into the population density in the various states of the U.S and the American household income spent on affording their homes.

<p style="color:salmon; font-family: 'Goudy Old Style'; font-size: 20px;">
	1. I wanted to show base map with country borders and names clearly outlined as my basemap so that I can give the audience the visuals of my road trip in Europe next year when I go study abroad in Denmark, the city of  <a href="https://www.superpedestrian.com/en">Bikes.</a><br>
	Given what I have learned thus far about coding, I started from the html foundation codes: head, title, body to include tilelayer, div, script, var, marker and so om to build my Leaflet map. In short, I didn't arrive at the end result till the end of the lab instructions and several side diversions that I took to test out some other functions offered by Leaflet such as icon, popup, polyline, etc.<br>
	From a design perspective, some key elements that help tell my story to someone viewing the web page are the content commanded by the vars that are written in the JavaScript language and generated by the divisions for the page, for example, the markers that specify my locations of interest and the popups further communicate my impressions of these locations. 
	These elements when written in the correct sequence, operate as expected and as thorough as the author of them intended for them to. How successful the codes are in telling the story depend solely on the author's capability, time and effort in developing the page. In a well-designed webs page, divisions can give the audience a dynamic experience by generating different scripts interactively.<br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color:salmon; font-family: 'Goudy Old Style'; font-size: 20px;">
	2. As explained above, the key elements to making a web map would be the basic HTML codes such as head, title, and body followed by the JavaScript codes within the divisions. However, the most important key element I'd argue that makes a web page live would be the syntax or order sequence & punctuations of the whole work. I experienced heightened  frustrations when the page breaks from a minor punctuation error such as <b>() {} [] ; and ',</b>. Content wise, the Javascript as a programming language determines the sequence of content and can make up the majority of the web page. Its role, together with divisions and web syntax provide the core elements to creating the substance for the web page. <br><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color:salmon; font-family: 'Goudy Old Style'; font-size: 20px;">
	3. The pros of Leaflet API is of several: making a web map with Leaflet is much more personal to the developers than Google Maps API because Leaflet is an open source that user can freely customize their maps, Google fixes the users' experience its default baselayer. In being an open source, Leaflet doesn't charge a fee like Google does at frequent usage. Leaflet doesn't restrict users by terms and policies implemented in Google.
	The cons of using Leaflet is that it lacks the user-friendly services that Google Maps does. Certain projects will need live data such as traffic that Google can readily provide to its users. Moreover, Google can handle huge amount of codes more efficiently than Leaflet, although it may be argued as negligible among developers.
